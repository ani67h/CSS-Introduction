    SAVE THE EARTH

  <p1>"To Save the Planet, Don't Plant Trees" - by Nadine Unger (Professor of Atmospheric Chemistry at the University of Exeter). You have been thinking that I just got mad. What the hell am I talking about! But, no I don't got mad. Even though in a interview with New York Times 'Bill gates' said that! </p1> <br> <br> 
  <p2>Not only Bill Gates said like that; there are some well known research done by MIT and other platforms like, Human land-use-driven reduction of forest volatiles cools global climate.</p2> <br> <br>
  <p3>So the question is why are they talking like this? Why are they telling to stop planting trees? Nope, the thing is not not that. Mainly, they are talking about the ratio of plating trees and releasing the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. I mean that, there is a great misconception among people that trees will absorb all the carbon dioxide gas so, we can freely do urbanization. Expresses that more urbanization more trees! But the problem is, only in 2019 we released 43.1 billion ton carbon dioxide! In research of MIT, they discovered that if we plant 1 trillion trees that can decrease the global temperature by 0.15 Celsius in year 2100. So then, how many trees will you plant? That's how our luxury could our danger.
</p3> <br> <br>
<p4>So what's the solution? Can't we do anything? No, obviously we can do many things. First of all, we have to teach peoples and work together. Then, we have to replace the factories that are releasing more and more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere also we have to make them environment friendly. But, remember it's a teamwork; it will only be possible when every one comes forward. <br> <br>
