#### **Origins of Football**
1. **Ancient Games (2000 BCE - 500 CE):**
   - **China:** The earliest known form of football, called **Cuju (蹴鞠)**, was played in ancient China during the Han Dynasty (2nd-3rd century BCE). Cuju involved kicking a leather ball into a small net, emphasizing skill and teamwork.
   - **Greece and Rome:** In ancient Greece, a game called **Episkyros** and the Roman game **Harpastum** involved elements of kicking a ball. These games were more physical and often included handling the ball.
   - **Mesoamerica:** Civilizations like the Aztecs and Mayans played ball games such as **Ulama**, which had ritualistic and ceremonial significance.

2. **Medieval Europe (500 CE - 1500 CE):**
   - Informal, chaotic games resembling football were played in medieval Europe. Known as **"mob football"**, these games were often played during festivals and involved entire villages competing to move a ball to a specific location.
   - There were few rules, and games were often violent. The ball could be kicked, thrown, or carried, and matches could last for hours or days.
