    <h1>WARP DRIVE TECHNOLOGY</h1>

            According to Einsteinâ€™s theory of relativity nothing can travel faster than light. But, there is still a hope remained. And it is about the Warp Drive Technology. It thrills to the beauty of astronomy!

            First of all it seems very easy and wonderful to hear. But it is not that easy. Although it is very impractical. Basically, it bends the space time in front of the space craft and expands the space time behind the space craft. And the space craft ultimately would be the space time. This is how it works.

            But the main problem is it involve a great amount of negative energy or dark energy or dark matter. As it is not practical because we are unable to discover dark energy and dark matter yet. Although our 95% universe is made up with dark energy and dark matter! Maybe we could require the huge amount of energy by building an Dyson Sphere on the sun! But there is great challenge to construct such a gigantic structure like it.

            And if we are able to achieve the Warp Drive Technology than it would be very efficient for interstellar travels. Even though we might able to discover external universe or parallel universe!
